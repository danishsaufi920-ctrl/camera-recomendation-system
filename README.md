Project Title: Smart Camera Recommender System (MATLAB)
1. Project Overview
The Smart Camera Recommender System is a MATLAB-based application designed to assist users in selecting the ideal digital camera based on their specific needs and financial constraints. By leveraging a dataset of modern camera specifications (price, resolution, weight, etc.), the system uses data processing techniques and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to filter, rank, and recommend the best options for Photography, Videography, or Hybrid use.
